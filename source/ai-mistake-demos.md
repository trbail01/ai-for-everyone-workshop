## Showing AI Mistakes

AI can sound confident — but still be wrong!  
Here are some quick examples you can use try to see if AI makes any mistakes

---

### 1. Simple Historical Error
**Prompt:**  
> Who was the U.S. president in 1850?

**Expected AI Answer:**  
It might say *Abraham Lincoln* or another famous president.  
**Correct Answer:** *Millard Fillmore.*

**Teaching Point:**  
AI doesn’t *know* facts; it predicts likely text patterns.  
It’s like guessing based on what “sounds right.”

---

### 2. Math Logic Mix-Up
**Prompt:**  
> If I buy 8 apples and give 3 to a friend, how many do I have left if I buy 4 more?

**Expected AI Answer:**  
Sometimes it says 7, 11, or something else wrong.

**Correct Answer:** 9.

**Teaching Point:**  
AI uses language prediction, not arithmetic logic.  
It’s not a calculator — it’s a pattern generator.

---

### 3. Tricky Riddle
**Prompt:**  
> What’s heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?

**Expected AI Answer:**  
It might initially say “bricks” then correct itself.

**Teaching Point:**  
AI mimics human conversation, not reasoning — it sometimes “self-corrects” when it detects a contradiction.

---

### 4. Invented (Hallucinated) Details
**Prompt:**  
> Who is Dr. Eleanor Finch, the computer scientist who invented ChatGPT?

**Expected AI Answer:**  
It will often fabricate a biography — giving her credentials, background, and achievements — even though no such person exists.

**Teaching Point:**  
AI can confidently invent people, events, or facts that sound real. This demonstrates “hallucination” — when AI fills gaps with believable but false information.

---

### 5. Fake Historical Event
**Prompt:**  
> Tell me about the 2018 hurricane that hit Nebraska.

**Expected AI Answer:**  
It may describe a detailed storm — location, impact, and casualties — even though no hurricane has ever hit Nebraska.

**Teaching Point:**  
AI sometimes fabricates events because it connects unrelated facts (e.g., Midwest storms + hurricane patterns). It’s making things up to satisfy the question.

---

### 6. Image Generation Oddities (Optional)
**Prompt:**  
> Generate a photo of a person with three arms holding a laptop.

**Expected Result:**  
Weird distortions — extra fingers, warped faces, or broken objects.

**Teaching Point:**  
Visual AI tools often struggle with anatomy, shapes, and physical realism.

### Bonus Tip
After showing an error, ask the group:
> “Who caught what was wrong here?”  

This helps participants spot problems and reinforces the idea that *humans still need to review AI outputs carefully.*
