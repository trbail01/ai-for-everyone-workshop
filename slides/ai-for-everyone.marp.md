# AI for Everyone

Welcome to the Community Workshop!  
<strong>Northeast Community College</strong>  
Presented by <strong>Trevor Bailey</strong>

<!--
Open warmly. Let people know the session is meant to be interactive, simple, and beginner-friendly.
Emphasize that AI is already in everyday life, and this workshop is hands-on.
-->

---

## Today's Goals

- Understand what AI is (and isn’t)  
- See examples of AI in daily life  
- Learn safe, responsible AI use  
- Practice writing better prompts  
- Explore free tools to try on your own

<!--
Reassure them the workshop isn't technical or intimidating.
Stress that the goal is empowerment, not complexity.
-->

## Icebreaker: What’s the First Word You Think of When You Hear “AI”?

Scan the QR code below or go to **menti.com** and enter code **4477 9071**.

</p>

💬 *Your responses will appear live as a word cloud!*

<!--
Encourage quick participation.
Use the word cloud as a springboard: note common themes like excitement, fear, curiosity.
-->

---

# **Timeline of AI**

<!--
Briefly introduce the idea that AI developed slowly over decades.
Mention that progress depended on computing power, data, and new ideas.
-->

---

## **1950s – The Idea Begins**

- Alan Turing asks: *“Can machines think?”*
- 1956: Dartmouth Conference coins the term **Artificial Intelligence**

<!--
Note that early AI researchers were extremely optimistic.
AI began as a philosophical question before it became practical.
-->

---

## **1960s–1970s – Symbolic AI & Expert Systems**

- Early logic-based programs and rule-based reasoning  
- Expert systems like **MYCIN** and **XCON**  
- Systems were powerful but brittle → leads to first **AI Winter**

<!--
Explain that expert systems were basically giant rule trees.
Point out the maintenance problem: the real world is messier than fixed rules.
-->

---

## **1990s – Machine Learning Rises**

- Shift from rules → systems that **learn from data**  
- Algorithms generalize better as datasets grow  
- 1997: IBM’s **Deep Blue** defeats Kasparov

<!--
Use Deep Blue as an example of narrow but extremely strong AI.
Mention Kasparov accusing the machine of “creativity.”
Clarify it's not general intelligence—just powerful pattern evaluation.
-->

---

## **2000s–2010s – Deep Learning Era**

- Big data + GPUs → massive leap  
- Major progress in vision, speech, and translation  
- 2012: **AlexNet** wins ImageNet and shocks the world

<!--
Explain that GPUs (made for video games) accidentally became perfect for AI math.
AlexNet cut error rates dramatically and started the modern boom.
-->

---

## **2017 – The Transformer**

- Google publishes **“Attention Is All You Need”**  
- Introduces the Transformer  
- Enables GPT-style foundation models

<!--
Emphasize that this architecture changed everything.
Transformers understand long sequences and context far better.
-->

---

## **2020s – Generative AI**

- Models generate text, images, code, audio, video  
- Foundation models adopted across industries  
- AI becomes mainstream technology

<!--
Mention that ChatGPT hit 100M users in two months.
Generative AI moved AI from background tech to something everyone interacts with.
-->

---

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

> AI helps computers recognize patterns and make predictions based on data — similar to how people learn from experience.

Examples:  
- Email spam filters  
- Voice assistants  
- Google Maps traffic  
- Netflix/Spotify recommendations

<!--
This is the “grounding” slide.
Make AI feel less mysterious and more like simple pattern recognition.
-->

---

## How AI Works (Simplified)

1. **Data In →** Text, images, numbers, or speech  
2. **Patterns Found →** The AI model learns from examples  
3. **Predictions Out →** The AI makes an educated guess  

> Think of it like “auto-complete on steroids.”

<!--
Keep this friendly and simple. No math.
Reinforce that AI doesn't "understand" — it predicts.
-->

---

## What’s Possible (and Not)

✅ AI Can:  
- Draft, summarize, brainstorm  
- Translate or tutor  
- Generate images or designs  

⚠️ AI Struggles With:  
- Accuracy  
- Common sense  
- Handling sensitive data  

<!--
Use examples. Point out hallucinations as a real risk.
Explain that AI is confident even when wrong.
-->

---

## Demo Time

> “Write a bedtime story about a cat that drives a tractor.”

Now watch what happens when we refine the prompt 👇

<!--
Use humor. Show how refinement improves output quality.
Encourage attendees to experiment without fear.
-->

---

## Poor vs. Improved Prompt

**Poor:**  
> Write an email.

**Improved:**  
> Write a polite, three-paragraph email to my landlord explaining that my kitchen sink is leaking and I’d like to schedule a repair.

💡 *Good prompts give context, detail, and tone.*

<!--
Explain why the second works: context, who, purpose, tone, details.
Mention that students often under-specify what they want.
-->

---

## Spot the Fake (Images)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/pumpkin-pie-real.jpg" alt="Image A" width="25%" style="margin-right:10px;" />
  <img src="images/pumpkin-pie-ai-generated.jpg" alt="Image B" width="25%" />
</p>

*(Vote A or B — which one is real?)*

<!--
Get quick hands-up votes.
Ask what visual cues they used: lighting, texture, odd details.
-->

---

## Spot the Fake (Text Version)

**Post A:**  
“Ran into an old friend at the grocery store today. We ended up talking in the cereal aisle for 20 minutes like we were still in high school.”

**Post B:**  
“Today I encountered a familiar face at the grocery store, and we shared a meaningful conversation among the shelves of brightly colored cereal boxes.”

🧠 *One is human-written, one is AI. Guess which.*

<!--
AI = Post B
Why it works: B sounds slightly too formal and polished for a casual social post.

Point out that AI tends to sound overly poetic, generic, or abstract.
Explain that detecting fakes is getting harder.
-->

---

## Play the Game – Which Face Is Real?

[whichfaceisreal.com](https://www.whichfaceisreal.com/index.php)

<!--
Encourage them to guess and discuss.
Explain how trained models can produce ultra-realistic faces.
-->

---

## Safe and Responsible AI Use

### ✅ Do:
- Keep private data out of AI chats  
- Fact-check important info  
- Use AI as a helper, not a decision-maker  

### ⚠️ Avoid:
- Sharing medical/financial data  
- Believing images/screenshots blindly  
- Uploading work data without permission  

<!--
Reinforce this slide more seriously.
Mention that AI tools store prompts, depending on the platform.
-->

---

## Everyday Uses for AI

- Recipes from your fridge  
- Poems, prayers, reflections  
- Learning new skills  
- Troubleshooting tech  
- Planning trips  
- Home/garden ideas

<!--
Relate to everyday life so AI feels approachable.
Mention how it can save time or spark creativity.
-->

---

## Prompting 101 Activity

📝 Try writing your own prompt!  
Example ideas:  
- Motivational quote  
- Weekend trip plan  
- Explain phishing to a 5th grader  

<!--
Walk around and assist.
Encourage specificity and tone-setting in prompts.
-->

---

## Key Takeaways

- AI is already part of daily life  
- Better prompts = better results  
- Always double-check AI  
- AI is a tool, not a replacement  

<!--
Wrap up the concepts clearly.
Encourage curiosity and ongoing experimentation.
-->

---
