---

## Today's Goals

- Understand what AI is (and isn’t)  
- See examples of AI in daily life  
- Learn safe, responsible AI use  
- Practice writing better prompts  
- Explore free tools to try on your own

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

> AI helps computers recognize patterns and make predictions based on data — like how people learn from experience.

Examples:  
- Email spam filters  
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)  
- Google Maps traffic suggestions  
- Netflix or Spotify recommendations

---

## How AI Works (Simplified)

1. **Data In →** Text, images, numbers, or speech.  
2. **Patterns Found →** The AI model learns from examples.  
3. **Predictions Out →** The AI makes an educated guess.  

> Think of it like “auto-complete on steroids.”

---

## What’s Possible (and Not)

✅ AI Can:  
- Write drafts, summarize, or brainstorm ideas.  
- Translate, tutor, or organize information.  
- Generate images or designs.

⚠️ AI Struggles With:  
- Accuracy (it can “make things up”).  
- Common sense or emotional understanding.  
- Private or sensitive data safety.

---

## Demo Time

Let’s see how AI handles a simple task:

> “Write a bedtime story about a cat that drives a tractor.”

Now, watch what happens when we refine the prompt 👇

---

## Poor vs. Improved Prompt

**Poor:**  
> Write an email.

**Improved:**  
> Write a polite, three-paragraph email to my landlord explaining that my kitchen sink is leaking and I’d like to schedule a repair.

💡 *Good prompts give context, detail, and tone.*

## Spot the Fake

Let’s test your instincts — which one do you think is AI-generated?

  <img src="images/pumpkin-pie-ai-generated.jpg" alt="Image B" width="25%" />
</p>

*(Vote A or B — which one looks real?)*

> 💬 Discussion: What clues helped you decide?

---

## Spot the Fake (Text Version)

**Post A:**  
“I can’t believe how quiet downtown was tonight — just me, the coffee shop, and a half-written poem about streetlights. Feels like a scene out of a movie.”

**Post B:**  
“Downtown tonight was serene. I sat alone with a cup of coffee and reflected on how the light of the streetlamps symbolizes peace and human resilience.”

🧠 *One of these was written by a person, the other by AI. Which do you think is which?*

## Safe and Responsible AI Use

### ✅ Do:
- Keep private data out of AI chats.  
- Fact-check all important info.  
- Use AI as a *helper*, not a *decision-maker.*  

### ⚠️ Avoid:
- Sharing personal, medical, or financial details.  
- Believing screenshots or images at face value.  
- Uploading sensitive work data without permission.

---

## Everyday Uses for AI

- Recipe suggestions from what’s in your fridge 🥕  
- Writing poems, prayers, or daily reflections ✍️  
- Learning a new skill or language 🧠  
- Troubleshooting tech issues 💻  
- Planning trips or events ✈️  
- Garden or home project planning 🌱

---

## Prompting 101 Activity

📝 Try writing your own prompt!  
Example ideas:  
- “Write a motivational quote about teamwork.”  
- “Plan a 3-day weekend trip to Omaha for food lovers.”  
- “Explain email phishing to a 5th grader.”

---

## Key Takeaways

- AI is already part of your daily life.  
- Better prompts = better results.  
- Always double-check AI’s answers.  
- AI is a *tool*, not a replacement for judgment.
